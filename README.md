## About Me

```
Hi there! I'm Vanessa Larrosa, a freshly graduated software developer from a vocational training program in Multiplatform App Development (DAM), now setting course towards backend development. I'm currently learning Java, Python, and will be starting with .NET in September.

I also built a simulation project with Unity and C#, and I'm exploring paths like app development and data science – because why stick to one when everything is exciting?

Before diving into tech, I was a preschool teacher. That background taught me a lot about patience, creativity, and teamwork. One day I wondered "how does this app work?" and… well, now I'm learning how to build them!

During my internship, I developed an interactive simulator for Haier air conditioning systems, using C#, Unity, Jira, GitHub and Plastic SCM. I discovered how much I enjoy building useful tools and collaborating with a team.

I’m curious, driven, and love asking questions. I'm looking for my next opportunity to grow as a developer, make an impact, and contribute to meaningful software projects.

If you want to connect, share tech experiences or talk about crazy ideas that combine coding and education — I'm all ears!
