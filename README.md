## About Me

Hi there! I'm Vanessa Larrosa, a freshly graduated software developer from a vocational training program in Multiplatform App Development (DAM), now setting course towards backend development. I'm currently learning Java, Python, and will be starting with .NET in September.

I also built a simulation project with Unity and C#, and I'm exploring paths like app development and data science ‚Äì because why stick to one when everything is exciting?

Before diving into tech, I was a preschool teacher. That background taught me a lot about patience, creativity, and teamwork. One day I wondered "how does this app work?" and‚Ä¶ well, now I'm learning how to build them!

During my internship, I developed an interactive simulator for Haier air conditioning systems, using C#, Unity, Jira, GitHub and Plastic SCM. I discovered how much I enjoy building useful tools and collaborating with a team.

I‚Äôm curious, driven, and love asking questions. I'm looking for my next opportunity to grow as a developer, make an impact, and contribute to meaningful software projects.

If you want to connect, share tech experiences or talk about crazy ideas that combine coding and education ‚Äî I'm all ears!
